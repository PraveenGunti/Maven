Maven
-----

Understanding the problem without Maven
There are many problems that we face during the project development. They are discussed below:
1) Adding set of Jars in each project: In case of struts, spring, hibernate frameworks, we need to add set of jar files in each project.
   It must include all the dependencies of jars also.
2) Creating the right project structure: We must create the right project structure in servlet, struts etc, otherwise it will 
   not be executed.
3) Building and Deploying the project: We must have to build and deploy the project so that it may work.

What it does?
Maven simplifies the above mentioned problems. It does mainly following tasks.
1.	It makes a project easy to build
2.	It provides uniform build process (maven project can be shared by all the maven projects)
3.	It provides project information (log document, cross referenced sources, mailing list, dependency list, unit test reports etc.)
4.	It is easy to migrate for new features of Maven
Apache Maven helps to manage
o	Builds
o	Documentation
o	Reporing
o	SCMs
o	Releases
o	Distribution
What is Build Tool
A build tool takes care of everything for building a process. It does following:
•	Generates source code (if auto-generated code is used)
•	Generates documentation from source code
•	Compiles source code
•	Packages compiled code into JAR of ZIP file
•	Installs the packaged code in local repository, server repository, or central repository

Difference between Ant and Maven:
Ant and Maven both are build tools provided by Apache. The main purpose of these technologies is to ease the build process of a project.
There are many differences between ant and maven that are given below:

Maven Repository

A maven repository is a directory of packaged JAR file with pom.xml file. Maven searches for dependencies in the repositories.
There are 3 types of maven repository:
1.	Local Repository
2.	Central Repository
3.	Remote Repository
Maven searches for the dependencies in the following order:
Local repository then Central repository then Remote repository.
