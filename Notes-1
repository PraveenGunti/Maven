Maven
Understanding the problem without Maven
There are many problems that we face during the project development. They are discussed below:
1) Adding set of Jars in each project: In case of struts, spring, hibernate frameworks, we need to add set of jar files in each project.
   It must include all the dependencies of jars also.
2) Creating the right project structure: We must create the right project structure in servlet, struts etc, otherwise it will 
   not be executed.
3) Building and Deploying the project: We must have to build and deploy the project so that it may work.
